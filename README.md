# OS Core Concepts & Systems Programming (C++)
A collection of C++ systems programming projects designed to explore and implement core Operating System mechanisms. These projects demonstrate my hands-on experience with low-level concepts, including inter-process communication (IPC), multi-threaded synchronization, and concurrent resource management.


Language: C++11 (GCC/G++)

Environment: Linux (Ubuntu)

APIs & Libraries: POSIX Threads (pthread), POSIX Shared Memory (shm_open, mmap), System Calls (fork, wait).

Key Concepts: IPC, Process/Thread Synchronization, Mutex, Race Conditions, Deadlock Prevention.
